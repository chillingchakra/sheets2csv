# Scriptik - The Production

This work, now I will make a million branches and make it not work in a million ways.

CHANGELOG

1130 on 1130-2017
Modified this thing to try and remove any XLSX files that have this weird ~$, I have not investigated this but neither the Windows CMD or Bash are able to remove it, permission is denied, as the file does not exist, but the OS and Python see it, regardless, it is apparently it does not spill over into the conversion. _Check **Line 58** in the script_

Honesto has screwed me, but we'll have to see till tomorrow. If he has, I hope he can fix it somehow, as I'm a poor man on the lamb.

13:28 on 1130 -2017

My first attempt at creating a script (from scratch) which permits me to manipulate the output csv file located in the csv-expo folder

20:11 on 1130-2017

Just succeeded in pulling from myself, salt and peppa

Update: Succeeded in authenticating via SSH on OS X, now to get it working on that shoddy Windows machine at work

Had a setback and then a setforward today. Git messed everything up, I switched branches and I guess I was supposed to stash, when I returned, my files were permanently gone. My solution is simple, use freaking Google Drive, it does the managing for you and I can go back with revisions and whatnot.

Now I also succeeded in getting csvmani.py to work somewhat. It prints out the whole array though, I still have to fix that.
